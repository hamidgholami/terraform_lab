# Practice Questions

1. What is Infrastructure as Code?

    ```txt
    You write and execute the code to define, deploy, update, and destroy your infrastructure
    ```
2. What are the benefits of IaC?

    ```txt
    a. Automation
    We can bring up the servers with one script and scale up and down based on our load with the same script.

    b. Reusability of the code
    We can reuse the same code
    
    c. Versioning
    We can check it into version control and we get versioning. Now we can see
    an incremental history of who changed what, how is our infrastructure actually
    defined at any given point of time, and wehave this transparency of documentation
    
    IaC makes changes idempotent, consistent, repeatable, and predictable.
